# CryptoClustering-
This is my completed module 11 challenge for submission. 

I must note this is, by far, the most confusing set of instructions. They are not in alignment with the instructions set from BCS. 
Moreover, some expected outputs and graphs in the starter code could have been useful to compare my outputs with. But they were 
not even there to begin. It seems the preparer of the starter code was a bit too laxed for this work, which in turn, made the 
completion of the challenge more complex and time consuming for me.

The worst of it all is there is a section in the starter code that is not even in the instructions list on BCS. I am pasting it here for your review:
"# Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data.
# Note: The code for this step is provided for you

# Creating a DataFrame with the PCA data


# Copy the crypto names from the original data


# Set the coinid column as index


# Display sample data
"
It was uselessly repeated. Plus, it says the code to do this is provided when no code was provided.

The mess started toward the end of the challenge.
I have yet to check this with the TA during office hours before submission.
